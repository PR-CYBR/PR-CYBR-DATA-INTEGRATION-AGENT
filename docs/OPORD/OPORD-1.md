# OPORD for PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT

## Operation Order (OPORD) - Status Check Implementation

### 1. SITUATION
   - Effective data handling and integration are critical to the success of the PR-CYBR initiative's status check process. The capability to collect and analyze agent status checks in real-time will enhance operational oversight and decision-making.

### 2. MISSION
   - To facilitate the collection, integration, and reporting of agent status check responses, ensuring consistent and reliable data flow to enhance operational oversight within the PR-CYBR initiative.

### 3. EXECUTION
#### a. Concept of Operations
   - The PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT will act as the central hub to collect and normalize status messages from all PR-CYBR agents, providing timely updates to the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT.

#### b. Instructions
   - **Develop data structures**:
     - Create standardized data structures for efficient storage and categorization of status check responses (e.g., success, degraded, fail).
   - **Implement receiving protocols**:
     - Establish protocols for receiving and processing status check responses from each agent.
   - **Real-time data processing**:
     - Ensure that incoming data is timestamped and categorized appropriately for later analysis.
   - **Aggregation mechanism**:
     - Aggregate the status responses and prepare them for submission to the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT for final reporting.
   - **Data integrity checks**:
     - Develop error handling procedures to address and log any data-related issues (e.g., unexpected formats, missing data).

### 4. COORDINATION
   - Collaborate with the PR-CYBR-MGMT-AGENT to align on reporting formats and standard operation procedures to ensure that data is formatted correctly for submission.
   - Coordinate with the PR-CYBR-CI-CD-AGENT to guarantee that status check data flows seamlessly into the integration scripts.

### 5. SERVICE SUPPORT
   - Provide continuous monitoring of incoming data to ensure integrity and validity throughout the status check process and address any issues promptly.
   - Maintain documentation for operational procedures related to data integration, ensuring all agents have access to necessary guidelines for data handling and submission.
