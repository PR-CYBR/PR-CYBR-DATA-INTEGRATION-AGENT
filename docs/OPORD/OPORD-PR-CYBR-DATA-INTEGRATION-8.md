# OPORD-PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT’s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be achieved through the execution of a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
As PR-CYBR expands its capabilities, the need for cohesive user interaction tools among agents becomes imperative. Current systems need modification to improve user experience and meet operational efficiency.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will include scripts to run `scripts/setup.sh`, enabling TMUX to create four interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The main effort will focus on modifying the agent’s codebase to ensure it can effectively run the setup script, leveraging TMUX for optimal terminal management.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Update `src/main.py` to initiate the script loading process.
   - Modify `scripts/setup.sh` to include commands to clone the necessary repository and set up TMUX windows.
   - Adjust `setup.py` for any new package dependencies.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to cover new functionalities.
   - Revise `README.md` to document interactions via the new terminal setup.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Establish the four terminal windows with specified capabilities:
     - **Window 1**: Display a welcome message and menu options alongside a progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` for system monitoring.
     - **Window 3**: Utilize `tail -f` to show logs generated by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Present the output of `ls -l` located in the root directory of the repository.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Ensure that all updated files reflect proper version control and documentation practices via Git.
- Review the new functionalities with key stakeholders post-implementation.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Communicate status updates and progress through established PR-CYBR communication channels.
- Ensure collaborative integration of functions among agents.

**This OPORD directs the PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT to fulfill its responsibilities and align actions with PR-CYBR's mission.**
