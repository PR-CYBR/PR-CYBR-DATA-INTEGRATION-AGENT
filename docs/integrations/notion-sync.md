# Notion Sync Integration

## Overview
This document outlines how the PR-CYBR data integration agent synchronizes Notion databases with GitHub project work items and repository issues. It summarizes the current automation flow, the data fields that are mirrored, and considerations for keeping state aligned between the two systems.

## Future enhancements
To deepen the integration between Notion and GitHub, the following enhancements could be implemented:

* **Event detection via webhooks or polling.** Register a Notion webhook (or schedule a periodic poll using the Notion API when webhooks are unavailable) to monitor page status changes. When an item transitions into an "In Progress" or "Ready" state, the automation can create or update matching GitHub issues or pull requests. When a page is marked "Done" in Notion, the workflow should locate the related GitHub work item and close the issue or merge/close the PR accordingly.
* **Bidirectional identifiers for safe updates.** Store the GitHub issue or pull request number inside the Notion page (for example, in a "GitHub Issue" relation or text property). Conversely, persist the Notion page ID or canonical relation property value within the GitHub issue body, metadata, or a project item field. Maintaining these identifiers on both sides prevents duplicate records and enables idempotent updates when statuses change.
* **Automation runtime components.** Use a GitHub Action workflow (scheduled cron job) or an external serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Function) to host the synchronization logic. The runtime must authenticate with a GitHub token that grants the minimal required scopesâ€”`repo` for classic tokens or the fine-grained equivalents (`issues: write`, `pull_requests: write`, and `project: write` when Projects are involved). The automation service also needs access to the Notion integration token with permission to read/write the relevant database.

By layering these enhancements on top of the current sync, the team can react to Notion updates in near real time while keeping GitHub artifacts tightly aligned.
