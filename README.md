# PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT

## Overview

The **PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT** facilitates seamless data ingestion, transformation, and synchronization across the PR-CYBR ecosystem. It ensures that data flows efficiently and securely between systems, enabling accurate decision-making and operational insights.

## Key Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Automatically fetches data from multiple sources (APIs, databases, file systems, etc.).
- **Data Transformation**: Normalizes, cleans, and processes data for consistent integration.
- **Data Synchronization**: Maintains up-to-date data across PR-CYBR agents and platforms.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust mechanisms to handle data pipeline failures gracefully.
- **Scalability**: Adapts to handle large-scale data flows with minimal latency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running scripts.
- **Docker**: Optional, for containerized deployment.
- **Access to GitHub Actions**: For automated workflows.

### Local Setup

To set up the `PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT` locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT.git
cd PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT
```

2. **Run Local Setup Script**

```bash
./scripts/local_setup.sh
```
_This script will install necessary dependencies and set up the local environment._

3. **Provision the Agent**

```bash
./scripts/provision_agent.sh
```
_This script configures the agent with default settings for local development._

### Build from Source

Alternatively, you can build the agent from source:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if not already done)

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Setup Script**

```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Cloud Deployment

To deploy the agent to a cloud environment:

1. **Configure Repository Secrets**

- Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` in your GitHub repository.
- Add the required secrets:
   - `CLOUD_API_KEY`
   - `DATA_SOURCE_API_KEY`
   - Any other cloud-specific credentials.

2. **Deploy Using GitHub Actions**

- The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/docker-compose.yml`.
- Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the deployment workflow automatically.

3. **Manual Deployment**

- Use the deployment script for manual deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_agent.sh
```

- Ensure you have Docker and cloud CLI tools installed and configured on your machine.

## Integration

The `PR-CYBR-DATA-INTEGRATION-AGENT` integrates with other PR-CYBR agents to provide consistent and reliable data across the ecosystem. It works closely with agents like `PR-CYBR-DATABASE-AGENT` for data storage and `PR-CYBR-BACKEND-AGENT` for data processing.

## Usage

- **Trigger Workflows**

  - Workflows can be triggered manually or by events such as new data uploads or scheduled tasks.
  - Use GitHub Actions or local scripts to manage and execute data pipelines.

- **Monitor Data Flows**

  - The agent provides monitoring features to keep track of data ingestion, transformation, and synchronization processes.
